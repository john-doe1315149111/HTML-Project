          <h2> Fried Rice </h2>
          <p> All of us have our own concept of fried rice. In my case, I had this notion ever since I was a kid. Fried rice to me is not as simple as it sound; it is a medley of different ingredients collaborating together to produce colorful and great tasting rice dish! </p>
          <h3> Ingredients </h3>
          <ul>
             <li>4 cups leftover steamed white rice</li>
             <li>4 ounces ham minced</li>
             <li>2 eggs beaten</li>
             <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
             <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
             <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
             <li>1 cup frozen green peas</li>
             <li>1/2 cup chopped green onions/li>
          </ul>
          <h3> Instructions </h3>
           <ol>
              <li><i>Gently mash the leftover rice using your hands to loosen it. Make sure that your hand are clean.</i></li>
              <li><i>Add salt and garlic powder and toss. Set aside.</i></li>
              <li><i>Meanwhile, heat the cooking oil in a frying pan.</i></li>
              <li><i>Once the oil becomes hot, sauté the minced ham. Continue to cook the ham for 1 minute.</i></li>
              <li><i>Put the ham on one side of the pan. Pour-in the beaten eggs. Cook one side for 1 minute. Flip the egg and cook the other side for another minute. Separate the eggs into multiple pieces by letting the tip of the spatula run through in a chopping motion.</i></li>
              <li><i>Add the rice. Cook and continuously toss every minute for 5 minutes.</i></li>
              <li><i>Put-in the green peas. Toss and cook for 3 to 5 minutes.</i></li>
              <li><i>Transfer to a serving plate. Top with chopped green onions.</i></li>

            <h2> Fried Tilapia </h2>
            <p>Fried Tilapia or any kind of fried fish is easy to cook. I’m sure that we all have our own ways of frying fish. I am sharing this recipe post just so you know how I do it. There is nothing special in my method. In fact, most of you might be doing the same.</p>
            <h3> Ingredients </h3>

                <li>2 pieces tilapia cleaned and scales removed</li>

                <li><i>When the oil is hot, put-in the tilapia. Cover the frying pan, but make sure to open it a little so that steam can come out. Fry each side in medium heat for about 6 to 10 minutes. Note: I usually wait until I don’t hear any sound. This means that the liquid is gone and the fish is crisp.</i></li>
